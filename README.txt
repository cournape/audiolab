Audiolab is a python package for audio file IO using numpy arrays. It supports
many different audio formats, including wav, aiff, au, flac, ogg, htk. It can
also be used for sound output to audio device (Mac OS X and Linux only).

A matlab-like API is provided for simple import/export; a more complete API is
available for more advanced usage. Audiolab is essentially a wrapper around
Erik de Castro Lopo's excellent libsndfile:
